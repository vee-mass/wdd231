        <li><span class="color-sample orange"></span> <strong>Orange (#FF9800)</strong> – for call-to-action buttons, highlights, and accents (represents energy and flavor).</li>
        <li><span class="color-sample beige"></span> <strong>Light Beige (#FAF3E0)</strong> – background color for a clean and natural look.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Poppins (Sans-serif)</strong> – for headings, modern and clean.</li>
